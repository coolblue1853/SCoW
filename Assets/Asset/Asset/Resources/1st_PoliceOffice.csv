1,Police OfficersA,@Hmm? It's been a while^ what brings you here.@,//최초대사
2,Fabian,@Well^ it's a request. How's ⓖ(Albert)ⓦ?@,
3,Police OfficersA,@Same as usual.@,
4,Police OfficersA,@...I'm telling you^ be careful and don't cause any trouble.@,
5,Fabian,@Sure. This one's no big deal.@,
6,Police OfficersA,@Anything else?@,//반복대사
7,Police OfficersB,@Hmm? I haven't seen you around lately.@,//최초대사
8,Fabian,@Yeah^ I haven't had a lot of work lately.@,
9,Police OfficersB,@Because the mafia and thugs have been quiet lately.@,
10,Police OfficersB,@What's good is good.@,
11,Police OfficersB,@Talk to ⓖ(Albert)ⓦ if you have any more questions.@,
12,Police OfficersB,@What^ you want to help me do my job?@,
13,Albert,@It's been a while^ ⓖ(Albert)ⓦ.@,Albert 최초대사
14,Fabian,@Oh^ Fabian. It's been a while.@,
15,Fabian,@I haven't had much work these days. To be honest^ I never thought I'd be racking my brain because things are too peaceful around me.@,
16,Fabian,@It's easy for you^ you're not going out in the field these days.@,
17,Albert,@Well^ that's...~@,
18,Fabian,@Why^ are you in trouble for bootlegging again?@,
19,Albert,@That's there too^ but it doesn't really matter because I'm only going to have to oversee it anyway.@,
20,Fabian,@So you got caught by the chief again? You got yelled at for your papers last time.@,
21,Albert,@I'm not saying it's not^ but...~@,
22,Fabian,(Then ⓖ(Albert)ⓦ turned slightly serious^ looked around^ and began to whisper in a low voice.),
23,Albert,@You know^ you're not supposed to say it anywhere?@,
24,Fabian,@Sure. When has information ever leaked out of my end?@,
25,Albert,@It is... There's been a string of ⓡ(●2ⓜmissing people)ⓦ recently^ four men and two women.@,
26,Fabian,@Missing people? Isn't that common around here?@,
27,Albert,@Well^ maybe for slum people^ but not this time.@,
28,Albert,@They were most middle-class^ solidly employed^ and there was no sign of them going missing. Their families were puzzled.@,
29,Albert,@And since the six people who went missing were all men who didn't know each other. Some people thought it was an isolated incident.@,
30,Fabian,@An unspecified series of ⓡ(missing people)ⓦ... that's unusual.@,
31,Fabian,@But wait^ I don't think I've ever heard of this before. Don't they put up flyers or something in the newspaper when someone goes missing?@,
32,Albert,@That's why I'm whispering. I've been told by my superiors to keep it a secret.@,
33,Albert ,@Not just to reporters entering the building^ but to the families of the victims.@,
34,Albert,@I think there's some sort of mafia connection between that^ but... Oh^ ⓖ(Maeve)ⓦ's gonna be pissed if she hears about it.@,
35,Albert,@Isn't there something spooky about this? People disappearing without a trace in the middle of a recent quiet?@,
36,Albert,@I'm just letting you know to be careful^ so don't do anything stupid. If I get caught doing this^ I will be disciplined.@,
37,Fabian,@Okay^ okay^ don't worry.@☆①,
38,Albert,@Anything else?@☆①,//반복대사
39,Fabian,@Did you see the article this morning? It said the stars are aligned.@,키워드 행성대직렬1
40,Albert,@I saw that in the paper^ too^ but it wasn't particularly interesting.@,
41,Albert,@That said^ we do have a lot of ⓡ(insomniacs)ⓦ in our office.@,//불면증1
42,Fabian,@Isn't that just because you work late nights?@,
43,Albert,@Oh^ I see.@,
44,Fabian,@Have you seen ⓖ(Maeve)ⓦ lately?@,메이브1
45,Albert,@No^ we're in the middle of a crackdown. I'm sure she'll be a nuisance. Say hello to her when you see later.@,
46,Fabian,@Yeah.@,

52,Fabian,@Damn it^ ⓖ(Albert)ⓦ^ you know what I saw in the sewers by the ⓑ(river)ⓦ today?@,Albert 오후 키워드 - 섬뜩한눈 1 
53,Fabian,@There were humans walking around with giant fish eyes!@,
54,Albert,@Hahaha... Fabian^ no^ that's not it. That sewer ⓡ(ghost story)ⓦ is a pet alligators^ not a human with fish eyes.@,
55,Fabian,@I saw it with my own two eyes.@,
56,Albert,@You...~ You're not drinking in broad daylight because you don't have a request these days^ are you?@,
57,Albert,@If you saw something^ That must be a ⓖ(●1ⓦsewer worker)ⓦ.@,
58,Fabian,'He don't believe a word I'm saying.',
59,Albert,@I've heard of that one. I've gottencalls asking if it's real until recently.@,하수도 괴담1
60,Fabian,@So what's the reality.@,
61,Albert,@Fabian... That's not possible in real life. Of course it's a ⓡ(●2ⓢrumor)ⓦ..@,
62,Albert,@About half a year ago^ we were digging under the sewers to check for smuggling routes^ and it's not a alligator-friendly environment.@,
63,Fabian,@There's been a ⓡ(fishy smell)ⓦ in the city lately. Have you heard?@,비릿한냄새 1
64,Albert,@I can't tell you how many times we've gotten calls about it.@,
65,Fabian,@Have you found the cause yet?@,
66,Albert,@Well...@,
67,Albert,@It's a small number^ but it's something that people on the outside know about.@,Reporting by Swain
68,Albert,@But it's probably best not to get too deep into it.@,
69,Fabian,@I recently found out during my research that there is a ⓡ(nightmare)ⓦ epidemic in Arkham.@,2일차추가Water and Nightmare
70,Albert,@ⓡ(nightmares)ⓦ? Now dreams are contagious too?@,
71,Fabian,@I don't know exactly either^ but the doctor said that there have been a lot of people complaining of similar ⓡ(nightmares)ⓦ lately.@,
72,Fabian,@Most people report ⓡ(nightmares)ⓦ involving the ocean or water.@,
73,Albert,@It's summertime^ which means a lot of exposure to water^ right?@,
74,Albert,@I think that's why there are relatively more water-related ⓡ(nightmares)ⓦ.@,
75,Fabian,@That's what I thought at first^ too^ but then I realized that the patients' conditions didn't make sense.@,
76,Albert,@Hmm^ that's weird.@,
77,Fabian,@Remember that ⓡ(fishy smell)ⓦ you've been getting lately?@,비릿한냄새 3가지
78,Albert,@Yeah^ why?@,
79,Fabian,@I looked into it and it seems to be related to ⓖ(sewer workers)ⓦ. Do you have any idea?@,
80,Albert,@ⓑ(sewer)ⓦ side and...? Are you sure about that?@,
81,Fabian,@The person who smelled the ⓡ(fishy smell)ⓦ said it came from a ⓑ(sewer)ⓦ worker.@,
82,Albert,@Um... I'll talk to the top of the organization^ because they've been having trouble with that^ too.@,
83,Albert,@Some of my subordinates also care about it too.@,
84,Fabian,@I see... Let me know if you find out anything more while researching.@,
85,Albert,@Of course.@,
86,Fabian,@Have you heard that ⓡ(river water quality)ⓦ has been weird lately?@,Details  <<하수도 근원 3키워드 없으면>>
87,Albert,@What^ like someone's been sneaking factory wastewater into the river?@,
88,Fabian,@No^ it's actually cleaner^ except for the fishy smell.@,
89,Albert,@So what's good is good... oh wait.@,
90,Fabian,@Hmm? Why?@,
91,Albert,@Come to think of it^ that ⓡ(●1ⓕfishy smell)ⓦ is circulating in the city.@,
92,Albert,@I got a lot of complaints about that... and some people saying it was a corpse or something.@,
93,Fabian,@Well^ Arkham can do that.@,
94,Albert,@Hmm. Maybe there's a connection between this ⓡ(●4ⓕfishy smell) and the ⓑ(sewers)ⓦ.@,키워드 획득
95,Fabian,@Hmm... something doesn't feel right...@,
96,Fabian,@Have you heard that ⓡ(river water quality)ⓦ has been weird lately?@,Details <<비릿한 냄새 3개 중에 있다면>>
97,Albert,@What^ like someone's been sneaking factory wastewater into the river?@,
98,Fabian,@No^ it's actually cleaner^ except for the fishy smell.@,
99,Albert,@a ⓡ(fishy smell)ⓦ..@,
100,Fabian,@Right? Isn't it weird?@,
101,Fabian,@It's a guess^ but I think it's the ⓡ(fishy smell)ⓦ that's been circulating in town^ coming from the ⓑ(sewers)ⓦ.@,
102,Albert,@Sounds like me too...  Will you look into it?@,
103,Fabian,@I'm thinking about it.@,
104,Albert,@Okay^ let me know if there's anything I can do to help.@,
105,Fabian,@I saw Maeve for the first time in a long time.@,Promise
106,Albert,@I haven't seen him much lately due to work^ so how is she doing?@,
107,Fabian,@It's the same as usual. More than that^ remember the ⓡ(planetary parade)ⓦ in the newspaper article last time?@,
108,Fabian,@Maeve says how about going to see an astronomical show on the night of the 14th ⓑ(Miscatonic University)ⓦ. What do you think?@,
109,Albert,@Let's see... it's not an on-call day^ so no problem.@,
110,Fabian,@So we'll get together that day?@,
111,Albert,@ⓡ(●2ⓟYeah^ yeah)ⓦ.@,천문쇼 키워드 획득
112,Fabian,@I came across some ⓖ(sewer workers)ⓦ who said they were unfairly fired.@,Unfair dismissal
113,Albert,@Hmm? Well^ that's not so new in today...@,
114,Albert,@Maybe he was laid off due to budget cuts. It's not uncommon these days.@,
115,Fabian,@Umm... that's right^ too.@,
