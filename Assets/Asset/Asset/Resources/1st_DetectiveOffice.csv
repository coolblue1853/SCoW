81,Fabian,'But can I say for sure that it has anything to do with her husband's current situation?',
82,Fabian,'To hear her tell it^ it doesn't seem to have bothered him until now',

92,Fabian,(She sighed and replied^ as if that was the answer she was expecting).,
93,Fabian,@I've been there^ of course...@,
94,Ella,@But the ⓑ(hospital)ⓦThey said they didn't find any abnormalities.@,
95,Ella,@The doctor said there was nothing wrong with him^ but he was just exhausted from the heat of the coverage.@,

106,Fabian,@Hmm^ I wonder how long your husband has been a newspaper reporter here?@,

116,Fabian ,@And do you mean to tell me that he also predicted that he was going to die soon?@,
117,Ella ,@I don't know if it was a prediction...  but he seemed to have a lot of confidence in it^ or at least it wasn't just something he said in a rambling way...@,
118,Fabian,'He was so sure he was going to die...',
119,Fabian,'But why did he tell his wife to run away^ instead of running away with his wife?',
120,Fabian,'if he's in danger of being killed and his wife has to flee^ doesn't it make sense to flee the city together?',
121,Fabian,'Why are the two^ who seem to be natural^ playing separately without interlocking.',
122,Fabian,"@So when he said run away^ did that sound like ""run away from your husband"" or did it sound like ""run away from Arkham""?@",
123,Ella,@I don't know about that^ but somehow the tone was that he couldn't get out of it.@,
124,Ella,@When I asked him to run away with me^ he said it was too late.@,
125,Fabian,@I see... thanks for the answer.@,
126,Fabian,'Whatever it may be^ it is an unnatural answer. Is there no choice but to meet and talk in personally.',

137,Fabian,'I feel a little guilty about this.',
138,Fabian,@I'll look into it as closely as I can since I'm in charge.@,
139,Fabian,@But I'll make it my first goal to find the cause^ which may be difficult to fix.@,
140,Fabian,@I don't want to risk anything more than I have to^ because th it may not be the norm. is that okay with you?@,
141,Ella,@Yeah... I know^ I'll use that to talk to the police if they catch something.@,

149,Ella,@Would that be enough of an advance...? I'll double it when we find the cause and fix it.@,
150,Fabian,(The envelope contains enough money to pay two months' rent.),
151,Fabian,@Of course^ ma'am. I think that will be enough.@,
152,Fabian,'The truth is^ it's been around for a while...',
