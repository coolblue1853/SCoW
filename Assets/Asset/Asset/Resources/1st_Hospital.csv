32,Fabian,@ⓡ(Insomnia)ⓦ.... Do you know the cause yet?@,
33,Kate,@I'm not sure^ but it seems like it would be best to ask the doctors for advice. @,
34,Fabian,@Didn't you hear anything about ⓡ(nightmares)ⓦ?@,에이든의 악몽
35,Kate,@I've heard that a lot lately^ with a lot of ⓡ(insomniacs)ⓦ mentioning ⓡ(nightmares)ⓦ.@,
36,Fabian,@That's weird^ an ⓡ(insomniac)ⓦ with contagious ⓡ(nightmares)ⓦ.@,
37,Kate,@Really. It's my first time hearing this while working here.@,
38,Fabian,@Is there anything special about ⓡ(paranoia)ⓦ?@,편집증 - 남편의 상황
39,Kate,@Hmm... I can't think of one^ so you'll have to ask the doctors!@,
40,Fabian,@Is there anything special going on at the ⓑ(hospital)ⓦ?@,병원 - 신문기사

50,Fabian,(The name tag says Alan P. Parks.),
51,Fabian,@You haven't heard about the contents of the ⓡ(nightmare)ⓦ?@,"""Nightmare - Aiden's Nightmare""  "
52,Alan,@The vast majority of patients are extremely reluctant to discuss their ⓡ(nightmares)ⓦ directly.@,
53,Alan,@Still^ overall^ the majority of ⓡ(nightmares)ⓦ seem to involve water or the ocean.@,
54,Alan,@Maybe it's a form of rabies^ but it hasn't been reported.@,
55,Alan,@That's what the patient said? ...and that gives us another example.@,"""Nightmare - Content of a Nightmare"" "
56,Alan,@Other patients are also mentioning a lot of ⓡ(●4ⓝnightmares)ⓦ involving water^ especially the ocean.@,
57,Alan,@Why this is happening is a question.@,
58,Alan,@Ohhh... Were you also trained in medicine? It's a complicated issue.@,"""Nightmare - Aiden's Detail"""
59,Alan,@But I'm thinking in the same direction. I'm looking at the ⓡ(nightmare)ⓦ as a direct cause.@,
60,Fabian,@I heard there's an epidemic of ⓡ(insomnia)ⓦ lately^ is that true?@,"""Insomnia - Newspaper Article""  "
61,Alan,@Yes. We're seeing more than we ever have before. It's baffling to us^ too.@,
62,Fabian,@So what about the symptoms themselves^ compared to before.@,
63,Alan,@Clearly^ this ⓡ(insomnia)ⓦ is unprecedented and unique.@,
64,Alan,@First of all^ it hasn't happened anywhere else outside of Arkham. It's like an endemic disease^ and it's centered here.@,
65,Alan,@On top of that^ the symptoms are unique. except medication side effects^ ⓡ(insomnia)ⓦ is usually caused by stress or anxiety.@,
66,Alan,@But in the case of the ⓡ(insomnia)ⓦ we're seeing in Arkham^ it's because patients are afraid to sleep.@,
67,Alan,@I wouldn't actually call it ⓡ(●2ⓘinsomnia)ⓦ^ more like a sleep phobia or aversion.@,
68,Fabian,@They are afraid of sleeping?@,
69,Alan,@Yes^ and I strongly suspect a ⓡ(nightmare)ⓦ as the cause of that fear.@,
70,Alan,@That's one of the things that most of our patients are complaining about.@,
71,Fabian,@You're saying that  ⓡ(insomnia)ⓦ is caused by fear of sleeping and that ⓡ(nightmares)ⓦ are a direct cause of that.@,
72,Alan,@That's right^ I haven't heard of such a disease^ but...@,
73,Alan,@Maybe it's an Arkham endemic^ like I said^ or maybe it's just mass hysteria.@,
74,Fabian,@I see...@,
75,Fabian,'This is more serious than I thought^ I thought it was just a tropical night thing.',
76,Fabian,'Based on what we're hearing now^ it sounds like a lot of people at Arkham are in a similar situation to ⓖ(Aiden)ⓦ.',
77,Fabian,@Is there anything special about ⓡ(paranoia)ⓦ?@,"""Paranoia - Husband's Condition"" "
78,Alan,@This ⓡ(●2ⓞparanoia)ⓦ seems to be driven by extreme sleep deprivation and fear^ and the ⓡ(nightmares)ⓦ that they see when sleep.@,
79,Alan,@In other words^ if the ⓡ(insomnia)ⓦ is solved^ the rest of the problems will take care of themselves.@,
80,Fabian,@Do you remember ⓖ(Mr. Aiden Triss)ⓦ^ I heard that he was a patient at your hospital and was examined.@,"""Aiden Triss - Subject to request"" "
81,Alan,@ⓖ(●2ⓐMr. Aiden Triss)ⓦ... ah^ I remember him.@,
82,Fabian,@How does it compare to others?@,
83,Alan,@We're not allowed to disclose patient information... but the symptoms are similar to the ⓡ(insomnia)ⓦ that's going around Arkham right now.@,
84,Alan,@That's all I can say about that.@,
85,Alan,@Well... I don't think I have anything to add.@,의사 Nothing
