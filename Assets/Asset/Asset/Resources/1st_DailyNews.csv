1,Fabian,@Good day^ sir. I'm here to ask you a few questions.@,Swain 최초대사
2,???,@We're a newspaper^ not a city hall information center.@,
3,Fabian,@Do you know Mr. ⓖ(Aiden Triss)ⓦ? I'm here about him. At the request of Ms. ⓖ(Ella Triss)ⓦ.@,
4,???,@You are a detective^ aren't you? No wonder you seemed shabby.@,
5,Swain,@Anyway^ if it's ⓖ(Aiden's)ⓦ request... I'm his friend^ ⓖ(Berkeley Swain)ⓦ.@,
6,Swain,@He's been in a lot of trouble lately. So maybe the problem is more serious after all?@,
7,Fabian,@Is it noticeable to others?@,
8,Swain,@Phew... It's weird if don't notice^ he's changed his personality 180 degrees.@,
9,Swain,@He was a good-natured and cheerful guy. But he said he couldn't sleep anymore^ eventually^ it came to this day.@,
10,Fabian,@I see.@,
11,Swain,@I don't like being associated with kind of detective^ but if I can help ⓖ(Aiden)ⓦ^ I'll help you. Feel free to ask me anything.@,
12,Fabian,'I don't know he's attitude is good or bad.'☆①,
13,Swain,@Why^ is there anything left to ask?@☆①,// 반복 대사

18,Fabian,(I brought up the question in response to a ⓡ(planetary parade)ⓦ article I read this morning.),행성대직렬 - 신문기사 키워드
19,Swain,@Ah that's right^ you were a subscriber to our newspaper too. you have good taste^ that's my article.@,
20,Fabian,@Do you know anything more than what's in the papers?@,
21,Swain,@Well... the astronomy department at ⓑ(●1ⓤMiskatonic University)ⓦ will set up their planetary observing equipment for the day and let us watch.@,
22,Fabian,@I see... Oh^ then^ do you know about ⓖ(Mr. Aiden's)ⓦ recent coverage?@,
23,Swain,@hmm. It's an unspoken rule among reporters that we don't ask each other questions like that^ because if I do^ I might lose the story I'm working on.@,
24,Fabian,@I've heard there's been an epidemic of ⓡ(insomnia)ⓦ lately.@,불면증 - 신문기사  키워드
25,Swain,@Yeah^ that's what Bailey's been covering. Well... it's been hot and humid lately^ so maybe they're having trouble sleeping at night?@,
26,Swain,@I'm not sure if it's for the same reason^ a lot of people have been reporting a strange ⓡ(●1ⓕfishy smell)ⓦ in the city lately.@,
27,Swain,@In my opinion^ wouldn't it be a rotten fish that came in from the ⓑ(wharf)ⓦ.@,
28,Swain,@Well^ I've never been one for dreams.@,악몽 - 에이든의 악몽
29,Swain,@He's ⓡ(paranoid)ⓦ? I thought he prided himself on being physically and mentally healthy.@,편집증

33,Swain,@Other than being ⓖ(Aiden's)ⓦ wife...@,

36,Fabian,@What can you tell us about ⓖ(Mr. Aiden)ⓦ?@,엘라트리스 - 의뢰대상
37,Swain,@He's always been full of vitality. There hasn't been any change in him since the first time he came in until now.@,
38,Swain,@If being too passionate is a flaw^ it's a flaw. So he got hurt once in a while and his wife was very worried every time.@,
39,Swain,@I can't believe it ended up like this... I hope he recovers soon.@,
40,Fabian,@I've been hired to find out why^ and I'm sure I will.@,
41,Swain,@Of course you do^ because that's why they paid you to do.@,
42,Fabian,@How long have you been with this newspaper?@,신문사 - 남편의 직장
43,Swain,@It's about 30 years now.@,
44,Fabian,@What do you think^ has anything special happened in Arkham lately?@,
45,Fabian,@It's unnaturally quiet to me.@,
46,Swain,@Hmmm... I'm not sure if this is a hunch or a shot.@,
47,Fabian,@What do you mean?@,
48,Swain,@Yeah^ well^ you might be able to help me. And no one would believe you if you told them.@,
49,Fabian,'This guy... clearly had a bad run-in with a detective.',
50,Swain,@What I'm about to do is something that very few people in Arkham know about^ you know what I mean?@,
51,Fabian,@You're telling me to watch my mouth.@,
52,Swain,@It's good that you understand quickly. Anyway... to get down to business^ there's something special going on in Arkham lately.@,
53,Swain,@There's been a recent spate of ⓡ(●1ⓜmissing people)ⓦ in Arkham. I've been investigating undercover for an exclusive story.@,
54,Fabian,@ⓡ(Missing people)ⓦ? I didn't hear anything in particular.@,
55,Fabian,@If it's a missing person's case^ shouldn't tell people about it so they can find it?@,
56,Swain,@That's true^ but I think the police have a different view.@,
57,Swain,@So far^ six people have been confirmed missing^ ranging from office workers to bigwigs.@,
58,Swain,@The cause is unknown^ and not like they left something and disappeared...@,
59,Swain,@It's continuous^ but it doesn't seem like there's a cause-and-effect relationship between these people.@,
60,Swain,@What's clear is that people are continuing to disappear^ and it's not just any disappearance.@,
61,Fabian,@I see^ thanks for the information.@,
62,Swain,@No^ don't thank me. You have your own sources.  Maybe you'll find something relevant in your investigation of ⓖ(Aiden)ⓦ.@,
63,Swain,@Then give that information back to me as well.@,
64,Swain,@You get something you didn't know^ and I get dangerous information safely. It's a give and take.@,
65,Fabian,@Okay^ we'll pass along any related stories as I Get to know.@,
66,Swain,@Yes^ that's good.@,
67,Fabian,'While his demeanor pisses me off^ this is definitely good information.',
68,Fabian,'Maybe if I ask ⓖ(Albert)ⓦor ⓖ(Maeve)ⓦ^ I can get some more information.',
69,Swain,@Well^ beyond that^ I don't know.@,그 외 키워드

71,Fabian,@I think your voice is louder now...@,
72,Swain,@...Hmm do me a favor and let me know if you get any more information about the string of ⓡ(missing people)ⓦ.@,
73,Swain,@I'll make sure you get paid. I'm doing an undercover story on it right now.@,
74,Fabian,@Okay^ so if ⓖ(Mr. Swain)ⓦ gets any new information^ please let me know too.@,
