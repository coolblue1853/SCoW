19,Fabian,(This is an old note.)☆①,일지 대사,,
20,Fabian,@Let's take a look...@,살펴보기,,
21,Fabian,(The notes were written in very dirty handwriting and were quite illegible^ but appeared to be some sort of plan and journal.),,,
22,,⒳Cthulhu's advent is made possible by a contract with Dagon^ a (planetary parade) when the veil between the Otherworld and reality is thinned.ⓦ, 회색조 이텔릭체,,
23,,⒳The location was crucial because five symbols needed to be carved for advent^ and if the symbols were damaged before the ceremony^ the advent would fail.ⓦ,,,
24,,⒳The best place to hide the symbols and work on it seems to be the (sewers) of Arkham.ⓦ,,,
25,,⒳Let's contact people's dreams there and choose the respondent who will be the living sacrifice.ⓦ,,,
26,,......,,,
27,,⒳We brought in deep-one from Innsmouth and started working under the (sewers).ⓦ,,,
28,,⒳Intimidating the stupid-looking (sewer warden) was a piece of cake. ⓦ,,,
29,,⒳His wife and children have already been sacrificed^ but he does everything in his power to keep his family safe. Funny.ⓦ,,,
30,,......,,,
31,,⒳To make it easier for deep-one to operate^ we've carved a marker into the (sewers).ⓦ,,,
32,,⒳There will be a slight (fishy smell)^ but it's (sewage) and people won't care.ⓦ,,,
33,,......,,,
34,,⒳Four symbols have already been carved^ and only one remains. The final sacrifice is a journalist named (Aiden triss) who has been scouring the area.ⓦ,,,
35,,⒳(Aiden) has been kidnapped. A henchman accidentally killed his wife^ but it's not a big deal now.ⓦ,,,
36,,⒳Advent is just around the corner.ⓦ,,,
37,,⒳I've marked the location of the last symbol on the map. Be careful because I've left fewer people to avoid detection.ⓦ,,,
38,Fabian,@P.S. If there is a disturbance^ it is permitted to accompany 'THAT'...@◐①,이성판정,,
39,Fabian,@Deep-One? Cthulhu? I don't know what the hell they're talking about...@,,,
40,Fabian,@At the very least^ I'm pretty sure that the guy who wrote this journal is behind everything that's happening in the city right now.@,,,
41,Fabian,@A symbol on the map... so erasing it may solve the problem.@,,,
42,Fabian,@I don't believe it^ but if that doesn't keep this shitty dream going... It might not be a bad idea to try.@,,,

49,Fabian,'This is.... It's a book about the rituals of ⓑ(●4Cthulhu's advent)ⓦ.',,,
50,Fabian,'The method is simple... just smear the blood of the sacrifice on the already carved symbols...',,,
51,Fabian,@Damn^ I read the wrong thing.@,,,
52,Fabian,(I tried to come up with something^ but the words and characters eventually drifted out of my head.),실패,,
53,Fabian,@Damn^ I read the wrong thing.@,,,
