14,Fabian,@Oh^ Fabian. It's been a while.@,
15,Fabian,@I haven't had much work these days. To be honest^ I never thought I'd be racking my brain because things are too peaceful around me.@,
16,Fabian,@It's easy for you^ you're not going out in the field these days.@,

26,Fabian,@Missing people? Isn't that common around here?@,
27,Albert,@Well^ maybe for slum people^ but not this time.@,
28,Albert,@They were most middle-class^ solidly employed^ and there was no sign of them going missing. Their families were puzzled.@,
29,Albert,@And since the six people who went missing were all men who didn't know each other. Some people thought it was an isolated incident.@,
30,Fabian,@An unspecified series of ⓡ(missing people)ⓦ... that's unusual.@,
31,Fabian,@But wait^ I don't think I've ever heard of this before. Don't they put up flyers or something in the newspaper when someone goes missing?@,
32,Albert,@That's why I'm whispering. I've been told by my superiors to keep it a secret.@▒⑧,
33,Albert ,@Not just to reporters entering the building^ but to the families of the victims.@◈⑩,
34,Albert,@I think there's some sort of mafia connection between that^ but... Oh^ ⓖ(Maeve)ⓦ's gonna be pissed if she hears about it.@,
35,Albert,@Isn't there something spooky about this? People disappearing without a trace in the middle of a recent quiet?@,

72,Fabian,@Most people report ⓡ(nightmares)ⓦ involving the ocean or water.@,
73,Albert,@It's summertime^ which means a lot of exposure to water^ right?@,
74,Albert,@I think that's why there are relatively more water-related ⓡ(nightmares)ⓦ.@,
75,Fabian,@That's what I thought at first^ too^ but then I realized that the patients' conditions didn't make sense.@,
76,Albert,@Hmm^ that's weird.@,
77,Fabian,@Remember that ⓡ(fishy smell)ⓦ you've been getting lately?@,비릿한냄새 3가지
78,Albert,@Yeah^ why?@,
79,Fabian,@I looked into it and it seems to be related to ⓖ(sewer workers)ⓦ. Do you have any idea?@,

81,Fabian,@The person who smelled the ⓡ(fishy smell)ⓦ said it came from a ⓑ(sewer)ⓦ worker.@,
