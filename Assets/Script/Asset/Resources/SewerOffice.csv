52,Warden,@Oh^ yeah! A couple of months ago^ some strange people started coming to my house and threatening to take my family hostage.@,
53,Warden,@They started by firing all the other workers and hiring their own.@,
54,Warden,@And then they said^ Stay away from me the (sewer)^ and if I talk about it^ They'll kill ^my wife and child...@,
55,Fabian,@I see... that's unfortunate. But it'll be fixed soon.@,
56,Fabian,@Whether it's me or the police^ this will be resolved in the near future.@,

67,Warden,@It's probably not as good as a full map^ but it's better than nothing.@,

69,Fabian,@Sure. I'm grateful for that kindness. Thank you^ Warden.@⊙③,지도획득
